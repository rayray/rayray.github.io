<h1>Privacy Policy for OrangeSite</h1>
<p>OrangeSite downloads content from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">news.ycombinator.com</a> and presents it in native iOS components.</p>
<p>OrangeSite doesn't track the links you visit from the app. Your browsing history within the in-app browser or the Safari app is not visible to OrangeSite.</p>
<p>The in-app browser does not share cookies or sessions with the Safari app, which is expected behavior on iOS 12, so you may need to log in to some websites even if you have previously logged in with the Safari app.</p>
<p>If you choose Safari as your default browser for external links, some links may open in another installed app on your device if the website is associated with the app. This is expected behavior on iOS 12.</p>

<h2>Login Feature</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OrangeSite may allow you to login to news.ycombinator.com, but this feature relies on scraping the website and is therefore unreliable, and may be unavailable at any time.</li>
    <li>Logging in will allow you to use basic Hacker News account features in the app, such as upvoting or adding a reply. Any of these in-app features are subject to change or break or be removed at any time.</li>
    <li>To login, you will need to enter your Hacker News username and password in OrangeSite, but OrangeSite does not store your username and password. Your username and password are used to login at news.ycombinator.com, and the app saves the resulting session and/or cookie(s) to enable account-based actions on news.ycombinator.com.</li>
    <li>OrangeSite will store the session and/or cookies(s) until they are invalidated by news.ycombinator.com, or when you logout via the app.</li>
    <li>When your stored session has been invalidated, or when you logout, the session and/or cookie(s) are deleted.</li>
    <li>Changing the password or otherwise modifying your account on news.ycombinator.com may result in your in-app session being invalidated, and you will need to login again.</li>
    <li>If the login feature is disabled or removed from the app, you will automatically be logged out and your previously stored session/cookie(s) will be deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third Party Integrations</h2>

<h3>Firebase</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Firebase Crashlytics allows OrangeSite to collect detailed crash reports. These crash reports include device model and OS version to help me reproduce and fix. (Sorry about the crashes)</li>
    <li>The Firebase SDK also enables some analytics by default, such as audience count and session time. I have not added any custom tracking events or customized the standard configuration in any way.</li>
    <li>OrangeSite does not track any interactions with the Hacker News website via the app.</li>
    <li>OrangeSite does not tie your news.ycombinator.com username and password to any tracking events or crash reports.</li>
    <li>OrangeSite does not tie your news.ycombinator.com session and/or cookie(s) to any tracking events or crash reports.</li>
    <li>Firebase Privacy Support Page: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
    <li>Crashlytics Terms: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics/">firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Fabric</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This is required for collecting crash reports with Crashlytics noted above, and this integration is expected to be phased out of OrangeSite after Firebase completes its acquisition/merge of Crashlytics tools from Fabric.</li>
    <li>Fabric Terms: <a href="https://fabric.io/terms">fabric.io/terms</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hacker News</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Of course, OrangeSite interacts with Y Combinator's Hacker News website. Privacy policy: <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/">www.ycombinator.com/legal</a> </li>
</ul>
